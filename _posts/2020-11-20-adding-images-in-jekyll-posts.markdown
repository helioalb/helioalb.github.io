# Adding images in Jekyll posts

In the `_config.yml` you should set the `url` with your site url.

In your posts you can do something like this:

```markdown
![New SSH Key](/images/github-ssh/3.png)
```

In this example the folders `images` and `github-ssh` were created (These folders are not default in Jekyll)
