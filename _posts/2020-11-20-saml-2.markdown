# SAML 2.0

**SAML** is an acronym for _Security Assertion Markup Language_.

## How does it work?

The idea is that an **identity provider** "talks" to a **service provider** something like this:

_Hey man, I know this guy that is trying to sign. Here are his name, email, and all that I know about him. You can trust in me._

This "talk" is made by an **XML**. And the traffic of this **XML** is made over an X.509 certificate.

## Scenarios

The user enters the **URL** of a **service provider** in the browser. The **service provider** "asks" to **identity provider** if the user can be authenticated.

If the user already is logged in to the **identity provider** (i.e. exists a live session with the **identity provider**), the **identity provider** "says" via **XML** that the user can be authenticated.

If the user is not logged in to the **identity provider**, then, the **identity provider** will ask to this user do its login. If it has success, the **identity provider** "says" to the **service provider** that the user can be authenticated.
